# SetHome

Note: ~This project will no longer be maintained, as I don't play video games anymore. Have a good one, folks!~ Me(KingIronMan2011) will maybe sometimes update this plugin, but I won't promise anything.

## Introduction

Looking for a simple set-home plugin? One without permissions, maybe? Well, you've come to the right place! SetHome is a lightweight plugin designed to do a few things.

SetHome allows your players to:

- Set homes for themselves.
- Go to their home.
- Delete their home.
- List their home.

This plugin saves each player's homes into its own file under the "plugins/SetHome/homes" folder.
